This program sorts an array using bubble sort.
The array is either created by the program randomly or reads a file named "inputArray.txt".
The user will be prompted to choose either to randomly create the array or have it read from a file.
The user will type "1" for random generation and "2" for it to be read from a file.
If "1" is selected, a random array will be generated with a length of 10 and each integer will be from 0-99.
The program then uses bubble sort to sort the array, display it to the standard output, and print to a file named "array.txt".
If "2" is selected, the program will read from a file named "inputArray.txt" and no other file names.
It will then sort the file inside the array using bubble sort and print to standard input and to a new file named "array2.txt".
